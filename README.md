This code implements a machine learning pipeline for predicting house prices using a linear regression model. It begins by loading the dataset from an Excel file named 'HousePricePrediction.xlsx' 
and handles missing values by dropping rows with missing target values ('SalePrice'). The dataset is then split into features (X) and the target variable (y) using the train_test_split function. 
Preprocessing steps are defined next, where numeric features are imputed with the median value using SimpleImputer, and categorical features are imputed with the most frequent value and one-hot encoded 
using OneHotEncoder. These preprocessing steps are combined into a pipeline using Pipeline and ColumnTransformer, along with a linear regression model. The pipeline is trained on the training data using 
fit, allowing the model to learn the relationships between the features and target variable. Finally, the model's performance is evaluated on the testing data using mean squared error and R-squared metrics. 
Overall, this code provides a structured approach to building and evaluating a predictive model for house prices.
